Various homotypic consolidation tests in one, organised by fake families.
This prevents homotypic grouping across families and isolates problems.

# Aus bus
Basic priority consolidation

# Acanthocyclops
species & autonym with different priorities.
Diacyclops stammeri & westfalicus have lower prio and should be merged into the synonymy of A.
 - Nervus stammeri (Kiefer) misses the author year, but should still be consolidated
 
# Haplophthalmus mengii
 The species exists as provisional, a synonym and has an accepted autonym.
 - Non provisional names are preferred

There is another version under family Moneraceae which is not provisional.
 
# Langeraceae
## Solter vulgaris Wheeler, 1906
 is a pro parte synonym. Together with Persus vulgaris it stays as the source said - they all share the same priority!
