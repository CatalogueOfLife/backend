Genera and species with different authors end up being merged as distinct, accepted names.
If the classification is "very much the same", these should be merged into one entry with the most prioritised source providing the authorship
and all decendenants being merged under.

The case of Mycetochara is difficult. IRMNG seems to have a good treatment of those 3 names:

 * Mycetochara Berthold, 1827 accepted as Mycetochara Guérin-Méneville in Bory de Saint-Vincent, 1827 [Family: Tenebrionidae]
 * Mycetochara Cameron, 1939 accepted as Rencoma Blackwelder, 1952 [Family: Staphylinidae]
 * Mycetochara Guérin-Méneville in Bory de Saint-Vincent, 1827 [Family: Tenebrionidae]

Merge infraspecific names as subspecies
and infrageneric ones as subgenus. Project names with uncertain ranks will be updated to a concrete rank.
E.g. 

>  Chelonia mydas agassizi Bocourt, 1868 [subspecies]
  Chelonia mydas doeringii Bocourt, 1868 [infraspecific name]

will become
>  Chelonia mydas agassizi Bocourt, 1868 [subspecies]
  Chelonia mydas doeringii Bocourt, 1868 [subspecies]
