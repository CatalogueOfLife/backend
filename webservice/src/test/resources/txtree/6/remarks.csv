1;"Iphiclides feisthamelii is considered a separate species based on differences in adult morphology (Coutsis and van Oorschot 2011, Lafranchis et al. 2015) and nuclear genetic markers (Wiemers and Gottsberger 2010; Dincă et al. 2015), despite very local hybridisation along the contact zone in southern France (Lafranchis et al. 2015) and extensive mitochondrial introgression in the Iberian Peninsula (Wiemers and Gottsberger 2010; Dincă et al. 2015). Its distribution includes the SW part of France, the Iberian Peninsula, and northern Africa."
2;"Author of the name is Giuseppe Gené (1800–1847), not Achille Guenée."
3;"Dapporto (2009) has shown that Zerynthia cassandra from peninsular Italy is a separate species based on differences in genital morphology. This was further confirmed by molecular studies (Zinetti et al. 2013)."
4;"Spialia rosae has been recognised as a separate species endemic to mountains of Spain based on differences in ecology and evidence from molecular studies (mitochondrial DNA, chemical profiles) (Hernández-Roldán et al. 2016, 2018). The species has already been included in Fauna Europaea (2018)."
5;"Gender agreement changes were applied consistently in accordance with Art. 31.2 and Art. 34.2 (ICZN 1999)."
6;"As descriptions of both Syrichtus alveus f. foulquieri and Syrichtusalveus f. bellieri were published simultaneously (Oberthür, 1910), the name used by the first reviser (i. e. Rebel 1914), Pyrgus foulquieri, should be used in accordance with Art. 24.2.1 and Art. 24.2.2 (ICZN 1999)."
7;"Recent studies have shown that Leptidea reali actually comprises two species, L. reali and L. juvernica. L. reali is known from south-western Europe (Spain, S France and Italy) and is replaced by L. juvernica in the rest of the continent (Dincă et al. 2011b). L. sinapis, L. reali, and L. juvernica are reproductively isolated due to female mate choice (Dincă et al. 2013)."
8;"The year of the publication of the name Anteos cleobule is 1831, not 1830 (the original plate [79], published in 1824, carried no names)."
9;"The name Papilio croceus should be credited to Geoffroy in Fourcroy, 1785, not to Fourcroy (Ganglbauer and Heyden 1906, D'Aguilar and Raimbault 1990, Grieshuber et al. 2012)."
10;"The date of the publication of the names by Linnaeus in Fauna Svecica (ed. 2) is 14 November 1760, not 1761 (see Evenhuis 1997, Bousquet 2016)."
11;"The year of the publication of the name Pieris balcana is 1969, not 1970. The publication year of volume 21 (1–4) (1968) of Biološki glasnik [= volume 70 of Periodicum Biologorum] is printed on the cover page as “1969” and, moreover, Lorković´s personal copy held in the Croatian Natural History museum has a hand written addition of the publication year “1969” in the header of his article (Šašić, pers. comm.). Additionally, the author´s name is misspelled and should be Lorković (see also Lorković 1969)."
12;"According to Lvovsky and Morgun (2007) the species is present in Russia south of the Urals in the Orenburg region. The subspecies Lycaena dimorpha irghiza was originally described as a subspecies of L. japhetica (Nekrutenko 1985), but we follow the decision in the taxonomic review by Lukhtanov (2000)."
13;"The year of the publication of the name Polyommatus ottomanus is 1831, not 1830. Lefèbvre cited the date 1830, which corresponds to the date of submission of his article, but the issue of the journal was published in January 1831. See Lefèbvre (1831)"
14;"The generic names Apharitis and Spindasis were synonymised with Cigaritis due to morphological similarities (see Heath and Pringle 2011)."
15;"The name Papilio roboris was first published in 1793, not 1789 (Lamas 2013)."
16;"Iolana debilitata has been recognised as a separate species based on constant differences in adult morphology (Dumont 2004) and mitochondrial DNA – barcoding gene (Dincă et al. 2015)."
17;"The year of the publication of the name and plates for Cupido lorquinii is 1850, not 1847 (Hemming 1937, Heppner 1982)."
18;"Genus level classiﬁcation in the subfamily Polyommatinae follows Talavera et al. (2013) based on molecular phylogeny. This arrangement partially concurs with differences in genital morphology (see Balletto et al. 2014, Coutsis 2017)."
19;"The year of the publication of the name Lycaena trochylus is 1844, not 1845 (Tremewan 1988, Olivier 2000)."
20;"The year of the publication of the name Polyommatus nicias is ante September 1829, not 1830 (Griffin 1931)."
21;"Polyommatus celina has been recognised as a separate species distributed in the Iberian Peninsula, northern Africa, Sardinia and Sicily based on molecular markers and adult morphology (Wiemers et al. 2010; Dincă et al. 2011a)."
22;"The author´s surname Sagarra should be without the particle “de”. It is listed as such in the members list of the Institució Catalana d'Història Natural in 1925 bulletin Vol. 5 – Num. 1. Generally, when the particle is written in lowercase, it should be treated as a suffix that goes after the first name (Welter-Schultes 2013)."
23;"Polyommatus timfristos is considered a separate species due to differences in haploid chromosome number compared to P. aroaniensis and mitochondrial DNA – barcoding gene (Vishnevskaya et al. 2016)."
24;"Genus level classiﬁcation in the tribe Argynnini follows De Moya et al. (2017) based on molecular phylogenetics. It is corroborated by extensive differences in genital morphology (Simonsen 2006a, 2006b)."
25;"The name Papilio eunomia was first published in 1800, not 1799 (Poche, 1938)."
26;"The name Papilio thore was first published in 1804, not 1803 (Hemming 1937)."
27;"Description of Boloria freija and Boloria frigga must be credited to Thunberg, not to Becklin (Thunberg wrote Becklin's dissertation), see Karsholt and Nielsen (1986)."
28;"Papilio ichnusa was first described by Hübner (ante 23 December) 1824. Vanessa ichnusa Bonelli was published in February 1825 and is a junior secondary homonym and junior subjective synonym, see Hemming (1937)."
29;"Among the species with red headed larvae within the Melitaea phoebe species group only M. ornata is present in Europe in southeastern Russia, the Balkan Peninsula, Spain, southeastern France, and southern Italy. M. telona is limited to the Levant and M. punica to northern Africa (Toth et al. 2014)."
30;"Melitaea celadussa Fruhstorfer, 1910 is considered a separate species distributed in western Europe that differs in genital morphology (Higgins 1932) and molecular markers (Leneveu et al. 2009, Dincă et al. 2015) from M. athalia, with hybrids known from the contact zone (Achtelik 2006; Oorschot and Coutsis 2014). The species was referred to also as M. nevadensis Oberthür, 1904, which is a junior primary homonym of Melitaea parthenie var. nevadensis Spuler, 1901, currently regarded as a junior subjective synonym of Melitaea parthenoides Keferstein, 1851."
31;"Melitaea varia was first described by Herrich-Schäffer (1851) in Systematische Bearbeitung der Schmetterlinge von Europa Vol. 6(48): 2 (Hemming 1937). Melitaea parthenie var. varia Meyer-Dür, 1852 (not 1851) is a junior primary homonym."
32;"The name Coenonympha arcánia var. orientális [sic] appeared in part 4 of the ninth edition of Berge’s Schmetterlingsbuch, which was published on 22 May 1909 (Lempke 1949), not in 1910."
33;"The name Hipparchia fatua was first published in 1843, not 1844 (Olivier 2000)."
34;"The name Satyrus neomiris was first published in 1823, not 1822. Satyrus neomiris first appeared on page 19 in Godart’s Tableau méthodique des lépidoptères..., published in 1823. The vernacular name Godart used in vol. 2 of Hist. nat. Lépid. Pap. France, pp. 88–89, pl. 11, figs. 1–2 (1822), »Satyre néomiris«, is unavailable, as it is not a scientific name."
35;"The name Satyrus azorinus was first published in 1899, not 1898."
36;"The name Satyrus semele pellucida was first published on 15 May 1924, not in 1923."
37;"Oeneis ammon is present in Europe in the Polar Urals (Tsvetkov 2006)."
38;"The name Papilio glacialis was first published in 1785, not 1783."
39;"Based on differentiation in mtDNA (barcodes) and differences in morphology, Pseudochazara amalthea and P. tisiphone are considered separate species from allopatric P. anthelea and P. mniszechii respectively (Verovnik and Wiemers 2016)."
40;"Pseudochazara hippolyte (Esper, 1783) is a junior primary homonym of Papilio hyppolite Drury, 1782. The oldest available name for this taxon is Satyrus mercurius Staudinger, 1887."
41;"Papilio afer Esper, 1783 is a junior primary homonym of Papilio afer Drury, 1782 (see Koçak 1981), as is Papilio afra Fabricius, 1787, because it differs only in gender. Therefore the oldest available name is Papilio phegea Borkhausen, 1788."
42;"The name Papilio tithonus was first published in 1771 in Mantissa Plantarum Altera, not in 1767."
43;"The name Hipparchia rossii was first published in November 1835, not in 1834."
44;"The name Erebia dabanensis was published on 13 November 1872, not in 1871."
45;"Recently, a population of Erebia was discovered in the Polar Urals and described as a new species, E. churkini Bogdanov, 2008, but is now considered a subspecies of Erebia callias (Tatarinov & Gorbunov, 2015). However, no further material is available, therefore it is tentatively considered as part of the European fauna. Erebia callias is a member of the tyndarus group (Albre et al. 2008) and ranges from the mountains of the Asian part of Russia and Mongolia to Colorado (USA)."
46;"The author of the name Papilio cassioides is Hohenwarth alone as indicated on page III of Reiner and Hohenwarth (1792), not Reiner and Hohenwarth."
