Systema Dipterorum	Systema Dipterorum	2.0, Jan 2011	2011-01-06	Pape T. & Thompson F.C. (eds)	Animalia - Arthropoda- Insecta - Diptera	\N	Systema Dipterorum* provides a comprehensive, online portal to knowledge about flies as well as a framework for organizing and integrating future data and knowledge. More than 150,000 extant species of Diptera have been described under >250,000 names. Systema Dipterorum contains an estimated 99% of all names in Diptera, but only about 10% of these have been peer reviewed. Systema Dipterorum provides a synonymic checklist to enable the user to find the correct name and basic nomenclatural data for each nominal dipteran taxon. Complete documentation on Systema Dipterorum, its sources, standards, status, and structure, is provided online.\* Systema Dipterorum replaces the former BDWD (Biosystematic Database of World Diptera) used in the 2005-2010 Annual Checklists.
