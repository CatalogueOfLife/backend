In addition to the data contributed to the Catalogue of Life, the original FishBase database also includes descriptive, biological, ecological, physiological and conservation data and more, and onward links to information in many other databases. Data entry and maintenance is done mainly at the FishBase Information and Research Group, Inc. (FIN) in the Philippines since the 1st January 2011 in collaboration with many colleagues and institutions around the world. The team was previously hosted in WorldFish since the start in 1990 (formerly ICLARM then called WorldFish Center between 2001-2013, and now WorldFish since 2013). FishBase is supported by a Consortium of nine institutions around the world that acts as the Scientific Committee for FIN. FishBase is funded mainly by the European Commission, and by several other donors. FishBase uses data and information from the Catalog of Fishes (CofF) developed by W.N. Eschmeyer at the California Academy of Science. In particular, FishBase uses CofF as the most complete and up-to-date fish nomenclator, and as a taxonomic authority list in a collaborative work of synchronization of the two databases."
