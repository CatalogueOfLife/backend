  This GSD is derived from C. Gielis (2003) Pterophoroidea & Alucitoidea (Lepidoptera) (World Catalogue of Insects, volume 4), as subsequently maintained and updated by Cees Gielis. The database has been edited for inclusion in the Catalogue of Life and updated by Donald Hobern. A current version of the dataset is presented as a web document at https://hobern.net.Alucitoidea.html. Version 1.0 includes updates to reflect recent changes in taxonomy and new species.
