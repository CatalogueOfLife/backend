Tests the Index Fungorum format with just 3 records using a denormed classification

Test a synonym which should use the classification of the accepted name, not the (wrong) denormed of the synonym.
The denormed synonym classification should not be created at all, i.e. only the classification of Trametes modesta should remain.
